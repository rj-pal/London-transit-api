# London-transit-api

The purpose of this project was to learn to use Python for API calls and advanced data wrangling through a series of tasks and a feature presentation about the final task. 

I learned to leverage the [Transit For London](https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk) API for gathering and utilizing various types of data available to the public. I wanted to highlight how the API could be used for creating value-added informational messages to clients of a hotel 
(see [slides](https://github.com/rj-pal/London-transit-api/blob/main/presentation_slides.pdf) and below for more details).

There are two notebooks:
1. london_api_project.ipynb 
* Contains tasks showcasing various uses of data gathering and wrangling for weather forecasts, bike stations, bus and tube lines, and routes on the tube.
2. london_api_project_main.ipynb 
* Contains the final task showcasing how to search trips from one location to another (airport to hotel in this case) and how the JSON file can be leveraged to obtain value-added information for the customer.

For the presentation aspect of the project, I took the stance of a **senior Novotel** (no affilation) employee who was working with the **City of London** in an initiative to increase public transit use in light of climate change and Covid19 while at the same time completing the required task.
